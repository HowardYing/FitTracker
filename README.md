# FitTracker
This is an Internal Assessment Project for IB Computer Science, 2017-2018. This program is designed to act as a fitness tracker, by accepting step counts and hours slept on a daily basis. The program will store this information and track the fulfillment of step and sleeping goals (which are stored and can be modified at any time).

The user will also be able to access past recorded data in a seperate menu, and will be given clear visual indicators on whether or not they meet their goal.

The GUI is displayed using Java Swing. Uses Java's FileWriter and BufferReader to store and load data in an external .svc file.
