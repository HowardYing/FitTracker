# FitTracker
This is an Internal Assessment Project for IB Computer Science, 2017-2018. This program is designed to act as a fitness tracker, by accepting step counts and hours slept on a daily basis. The program will store this information and make targeted health goals based on user inputted demographic information (which is also stored).

The program will ask for the user's name, age, gender, height, and weight, in order to make accurate step and sleep targets for their demographic. The user will also be able to access past recorded data in a seperate menu, and will be given clear visual indicators on whether or not they meet their goal.

The GUI is displayed using Java Swing. Uses Java's Files and I/O package to store and load data in an external data file.
